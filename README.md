# Choir_music
It's a web application, where you can learn about being a choir member 
and practise your ability to sing certain songs given in this app.

It's a little choir library where you can choose your song or search for concrete song (by searcher)
This app gives you music notes for this song, 4 different audio files (4 voices in choir!), lyrics and recorder.

Whatever voice you have chosen you can play combined audio and practice with other voices.
You can easiy navigate in song in progress bar, change volume and playbackrate if the song is too fast or too slow for you.
If you want to practice it locally you can download music sheet or audio or even your own recording.

If you don't know how to read notes there is other tab "learning notes" where you can play the sound (note) on the piano with given letter,
and see the score below. For fun you also can simply play this piano :) by computer keyboard
